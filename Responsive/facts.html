            <ul>
                    <li>Expensive Build – The Titanic cost $7.5 million to build in 1912 (over $200 million today).</li>
                    <li>Three "Fake" Funnels – The ship had four large smokestacks, but only three were functional. The fourth was just for show and ventilation.</li>
                    <li>Advanced for Its Time – It had electric elevators, a heated swimming pool, and a gym—luxuries uncommon on ships at the time.</li>

                            <li>Wealthy & Famous On Board – Some of the richest people of the time, including John Jacob Astor IV (worth $87 million then, billions today), were on board.</li>
                            <li>A Cat Named Jenny – Titanic had a ship cat named Jenny, who supposedly left the ship before its voyage—some believe it was a sign of bad luck.</li>

            <class="banner_photo" img src="images/The_Titanic_Sinking.jpg" alt="Titanic Sinking">

                <ul>
                        <li>A Nearby Ship Ignored Distress Calls – The SS Californian, about 10-20 miles away, saw Titanic’s distress flares but didn’t respond, possibly due to a miscommunication.</li>
                        <li>It Broke in Two – Many believed the ship sank in one piece until the wreck was found in 1985, confirming it split before sinking.</li>
                        <li>The Band Played Until the End – The ship’s musicians continued playing to keep passengers calm, even as the ship went under.</li>
                        <li>More Lifeboats Could Have Saved Hundreds – Titanic had 20 lifeboats, but it was designed to carry 64. Many lifeboats left half-empty.</li>
                        <li>The Iceberg May Have Been Spotted Too Late – Due to missing binoculars (left behind by a crew member who wasn’t on board), the lookouts couldn’t see the iceberg early enough.</li>
                        <li>One Baker Survived by Drinking Alcohol – Charles Joughin, the ship’s chief baker, kept drinking alcohol and survived hours in the freezing water because it may have slowed hypothermia.</li>
                        <li>Debris Was Found Months Later – Some wreckage washed up in Canada months after the disaster.</li>
                    </ul>
